Abstract:â€”In recent years with the evolution of online booking platforms and free cancellation policy up to 24 hrs before the arrival increased the chances of cancellations. This situation provides the flexibility to the customers on the other hand it creates a financial threat to the hotel managers and managing the occupancy rate of the hotels will also be difficult. So it is very important to understand the customer behaviour towards the cancellations. In this paper we are proposing feature importance and univariate feature selection methods. To eliminate the outliers.we have used the Z -score method and IQR(InterQuartile Range) methods. Finally, to classify the data whether the data trend belongs to the confirm booking or cancelation group is determined by SVM and Naive Bayes classifier. Each algorithm is evaluated on the selected features of both the methods. Since accuracy isthe generalised parameter we have used precision, recall and F1 score parameters. Classification report and confusion matrix is constructed to further evaluate the model performance on the test cases.
